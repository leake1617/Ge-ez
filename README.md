A specialized repository focused on Ge'ez (Ethiopic) script processing using Google Colab. This project provides tools and notebooks for handling the unique linguistic and computational requirements of the Ge'ez language.

# Getting Started

To run the codes in this repository without installing anything on your computer:

1. Click the **Open in Colab** badge above.
2. Once the notebook opens in Google Colab, sign in to your Google account.
3. If the project requires specific data files, make sure to upload them to the Colab session or link your Google Drive as prompted in the notebook.
4. Go to the menu: **Runtime** -> **Run all**.

## Features
- **Script Handling:** Processing and manipulation of Ge'ez Unicode characters.
- **Notebook-Based:** Fully interactive environment optimized for Google Colab.
- **Easy Integration:** Ready-to-use snippets for Ethiopic NLP or data analysis.

## Requirements
Since this is a Colab project, most dependencies are handled automatically. However, the notebooks typically use:
* `python 3.x`
* `pandas` / `numpy` (for data handling)


##  Repository Structure
* `/` : Main directory containing the `.ipynb` notebooks.
